>Display tips that help people discover features in your app.

Apple has introduced the TipKit to help us to show users some tips. It is an excellent framework to use with ease. As long as the minimum deployment target is 17 or above showing a tip will be helpful on some parts of the app.
The most important part about TipKit is the frequency might be updated easily. So that we do not have to spend time managing the tip's frequency.
